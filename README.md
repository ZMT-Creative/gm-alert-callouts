# goldmark-gh-alerts

goldmark-gh-callout is an extension for the
[goldmark](http://github.com/yuin/goldmark) that allows you to use [GitHub
alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts).

This is a fork of
[thiagokokada/goldmark-gh-alerts](https://github.com/thiagokokada/goldmark-gh-alerts).

## State of the project

If you want to use it in your own project feel free, but I recommend either
pinning a commit or forking since the API is not guarantee to be stable.

## Example
