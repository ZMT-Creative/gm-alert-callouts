# Example Alert/Callouts

Some text with a GitHub **Important** alert:

This is a standard GitHub-style Alert (also used for non-folding Obsidian Callouts):

```markdown
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a GitHub important alert!
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a GitHub important alert!

---

This is a **Tip** alert using a foldable callout that is closed by default:

```markdown
> [!TIP]-
> This is a GitHub tip in a closed callout.
```

> [!TIP]-
> This is a GitHub tip in a closed callout.
>
> With multiple lines of text.

---

This is an **Info** alert using a foldable callout that is open by default:

```markdown
> [!INFO]+
> This is a an info alert in a foldable callout (open by default).
```

> [!INFO]+
> This is a an info alert in a foldable callout (open by default).

---

This is a **TL;DR** Callout:

```markdown
> [!tldr]
>
> This is a TL;DR (To Long; Didn't Read) callout.
```

> [!tldr]
>
> This is a TL;DR (To Long; Didn't Read) callout.

*...now using the custom title feature...*

```markdown
> [!tldr] TL;DR
>
> This is a TL;DR (To Long; Didn't Read) callout.
```

> [!tldr] TL;DR
>
> This is a TL;DR (To Long; Didn't Read) callout.

---

You can use the custom title to set any title and use an existing recognized marker to pick the icon to use:

```markdown
> [!Important] TL;DR
>
> This is a TL;DR (To Long; Didn't Read) callout, but using the IMPORTANT marker so it uses the color and icon of IMPORTANT.
```

> [!Important] TL;DR
>
> This is a TL;DR (To Long; Didn't Read) callout, but using the IMPORTANT marker so it uses the color and icon of IMPORTANT.
