## Folding Examples

You can also use folding functionality with any of these callouts (*if Folding is enabled, which it
is by default*). The extension looks for a `+` or `-` directly after the `]` and if it finds one of
them it will use the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements to render foldable content. If you do not
include one of these two symbols, the extension will treat the callout as a standard non-foldable
callout and revert to using `<div>` elements (*even if Folding is enabled*).

If Folding is **disabled** then all callouts will be treated the same (*i.e., the `+` or `-` are ignored*).

### Closed by Default

```markdown
> [!TIP]-
> This tip callout is closed by default due to the minus sign.
```

> [!TIP]-
> This tip callout is closed by default due to the minus sign.

### Open by Default (Explicit)

```markdown
> [!IMPORTANT]+
> This important callout is explicitly marked as open by default with the plus sign.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]+
> This important callout is explicitly marked as open by default with the plus sign.

## Custom Titles

All callouts support custom titles.

### Use Existing Icon with Custom Title

If you use a recognized icon entry, it will use the icon configured for that entry and the custom text for the title.

```markdown
> [!SUCCESS] Mission Accomplished
> You can override the default title with any custom text.
```

> [!SUCCESS] Mission Accomplished
> You can override the default title with any custom text.

### The Custom Title is Rendered As-Is

The title is rendered as-is -- case selection in the custom title is unchanged by the extension!

```markdown
> [!SUCCESS] MiSsIoN AcCoMpLiShEd
> You can override the default title with any custom text.
```

> [!SUCCESS] MiSsIoN AcCoMpLiShEd
> You can override the default title with any custom text.

### Unknown Callout

If you use an unknown callout name (in this example 'FOO'), the extension will use 'Foo' as the
callout title and set the `data-callout="foo"` attribute. If your CSS does not have an entry for
`[data-attribute="foo"]` it will use whatever default style you configured in your CSS (*see [CSS
Styles](#css-styles) below*).

```markdown
> [!FOO]
> You can use an unrecognized entry for the callout.
```

> [!FOO]
> You can use an unrecognized entry for the callout.

### No-Icon Callout Style

If you want to create a callout with no icon, you can use the callout name 'noicon' (*or 'none', 'nil' or
'null'*). If you don't supply a custom title, it will render the title using whichever of these
recognized 'noicon' variants you used.

```markdown
> [!NoIcon]
> This is an icon-less callout.
```

> [!NoIcon]
> This is an icon-less callout.

_**This is probably NOT what you want, so you should use a Custom Title instead:**_

```markdown
> [!Null] FooBar
> This is an icon-less callout with the title 'FooBar'. Since 'FooBar' is not a recognized callout
> name, it will use the default style (*in this case using blue*).
```

> [!Null] FooBar
> This is an icon-less callout with the title 'FooBar'. Since 'FooBar' is not a recognized callout
> name, it will use the default style (*in this case using blue*).

### No Icon Callout with Recognized Custom Title

```markdown
> [!NoIcon] Warning
> This creates a Warning Callout without the Warning Icon, but will be styled using `data-callout="warning"`
> rather than the default styling, because 'warning' is a defined callout name.
```

> [!NoIcon] Warning
> This creates a Warning Callout without the Warning Icon, but will be styled using
> `data-callout="warning"` rather than the default styling, because 'warning' is a defined callout name.
